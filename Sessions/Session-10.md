- **Battle:**
  - Wolves attack despite negotiations.
  - Emrys nearly mauled; Lily healing spirit (spiritual skunk) saves the day.
  - Pyr smites wolves in dazzling displays.
  - Cat snipes carefully but distractedly.
  - Charon’s vision of wolves comes true; uses magic to devastating effect.
  - Emrys and Charon escalate their "fake marriage" bit hilariously mid-battle.

- **Aftermath:**
  - Charon confronts Emrys about the "marriage" bit.
  - Emrys refuses to break the bit — divorce declared dramatically.

### 🏕️ Downtime in Nadira
- **Charon:**
  - Helps set up festival decorations.
  - Throws out back ignoring a vision.
  - Pyr heals him — lighthearted scolding.

- **Cat:**

  - Confirms it's primarily deadly via injection; ingestion causes feign death.

  - Discovers the "untamed flame" aspects of Pyre — spirit of creation, destruction, and forging one's path.
  - Starts to question her traditional upbringing.

  - Dinner discussion about forging one’s own path.
  - Emrys encourages Pyr to be bold and carve her destiny.
