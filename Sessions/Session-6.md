## 📅 Session 6 (9/13/24) — Stone Ridge and Smoldering Tensions

---

### 🛒 Journey to Stone Ridge
- **Traveling with Bendus Strongfist:**
  - Cat motion-sick; Charon miserable; Pyr starts a travel game to pass the time.
  - Bendus shares his past:
    - Sister was a follower of Pyre, died to a dragon.
    - His town worships Merrik (trade) and Pyre (forge and rage).
    - Daughter Lucilda dreams of Breckendale Academy, studying as a barbarian.

- **Pyriana's Past Revealed:**
  - Pyr explains her complicated relationship with Pyre:
    - Named her son Selson to honor Pyre's lineage — accidentally angered the god.
    - Received a vision — Pyre turned his back on her.
    - Stands by her son's name despite her community’s pressure.
  - Lily challenges Pyr to reflect: Must you always apologize to those who will never be satisfied?

### 🏰 Arrival at Stone Ridge
- **First Impressions:**
  - Town ringed by sturdy stone walls — excess rock from the mines.
  - Pyr inadvertently "blesses" the cart with a powerful fart, nearly suffocating all aboard.
  - "Through the Fire and the Farts" becomes the team's new anthem.

- **Cultural Lore:**
  - Town invented "Lute Hero III: Legends of Bardcore."
  - Cat playfully roasts Pyr for her devotion to problematic dudes (gods and exes alike).

### 🏛️ City Hall Shenanigans
- **Attempting to Meet Governor Holdan Glenhuck:**
  - Lobby Clerk Roz (goblin, coffee addict, Employee of the Month) guards the schedule fiercely.
  - Charon attempts diplomacy — frustration mounts.
  - Emrys, Lily (as a spider), and Cat attempt a sneaky distraction plan — chaotic failure.
  - Bribery eventually succeeds (barely).

- **Meeting Governor Holdan Glenhuck:**
  - Honest, weary leader; married to a hobgoblin woman, Frakki.
  - Describes Rakran’s rise:
    - Once advocated goblin equality.
    - Now preaches goblin supremacy after losing the election.
    - Incites a fanatical following; dangerous, well-armed.
  - Prefers a diplomatic solution but authorizes the party to act as needed.
  - Cat offers forgery skills to help undermine Rakran if necessary.
