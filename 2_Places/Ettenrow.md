# ⚔️ Ettenrow
[Home](/README.md)
---

## General Description
A divided village standing in the shadow of the ancient Founder’s Tree. Ettenrow is split cleanly down its center by an invisible line: Axebright on the northern side, Dellan on the southern.

Each side mirrors the other — two taverns, two marketplaces, two patrols of guards — but the villagers are bound by a centuries-old blood feud whose original cause has long been forgotten (or deliberately obscured).

The Founder’s Tree — massive, gnarled, and sprawling — watches silently over the generations of hatred and stubborn pride.

## Notable Features
- **The Founder’s Tree:**  
  A colossal tree said to have been planted by the original settlers of Ettenrow. Sacred and forbidden ground; duels fought beneath its branches are considered binding.

- **The Twin Taverns:**  
  - *The Axebright Arms:* Known for louder songs and stronger drinks.  
  - *The Dellan’s Rest:* Favored by quieter schemers and duelists.

- **The Mirror Market:**  
  A split-open plaza where merchants from both sides set up — though trades between Axebright and Dellan families are rarely friendly.

## Important Inhabitants
- **Matriarch Jessa Axebright:**  
  A fierce, silver-haired woman who rules her side with a heavy hand and an iron heart.

- **Patriarch Tomas Dellan:**  
  A gaunt, stubborn man who believes strength lies in patience and quiet scheming.

- **Old Wren:**  
  Neutral caretaker of the Founder’s Tree. Rumored to be far older than she appears.

## Recent Events
- **The Shattered Equinox:**  
  A recent ritual under the Founder’s Tree went awry, causing a magical rift to momentarily appear — blamed alternately on Axebright or Dellan saboteurs.

- **Dueling Ban Lifted:**  
  Centuries-old restrictions on blood duels were quietly lifted by secret agreement — and bloodshed followed.

- **Mysterious Visions:**  
  Several young villagers report seeing "echoes" of ancient founders wandering the village at night.

## Cultural Notes
- **Feud Etiquette:**  
  It’s considered a grievous insult to drink from the wrong tavern without offering a duel challenge.

- **Founder’s Day:**  
  Once a unifying celebration; now held separately by each side — identical in form, bitter in spirit.

- **Local Sayings:**  
  - "Blood remembers, even when the mind forgets."  
  - "Bury an axebright blade and a dellan curse blooms."

## Rumors and Secrets
- Some believe the Founder’s Tree itself has grown restless — and that it may judge Ettenrow’s descendants if the blood feud continues much longer.
- Others claim a hidden third family was erased from history — and their descendants are quietly working to reclaim the village.
