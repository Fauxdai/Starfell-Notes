## General Description
A bustling farming and trade town surrounded by endless golden fields of grain and wildflowers. The town itself is a patchwork of colorful buildings, bustling markets, and lively taverns. Merchants, adventurers, farmers, and scholars converge here, bringing both prosperity and a steady undercurrent of secrets.

Sevella is known for its open-air Golden Market and its obsession with coffee culture, imported from distant coasts.
