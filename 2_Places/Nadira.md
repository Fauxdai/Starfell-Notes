# 🏡 Nadira
[Home](/README.md)
---

## General Description
A small, serene village tucked into lush hills and ancient groves. The homes of Nadira are built directly into the earth — cozy hobbit-like dens with round doors and gardens overflowing with vegetables and flowers.

Life moves slowly here. Songs are sung at sunset, cider flows freely, and even strangers are welcomed — cautiously, but warmly — at the communal tables.

  - **Blooming Moon Festival:** A quieter rite celebrating the orchard spirits.

- **Local Sayings:**

  - "A kindness planted blooms in the next life."

## Rumors and Secrets
