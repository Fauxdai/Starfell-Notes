## Setting Overview

Breckendale Adventuring Academy, one of two major academies in Liligorn, is renowned for its elite Cleric, Bard, Druid, and Warlock programs. Situated between the Middle and Upper Rings of Breckendale, the Academy boasts a sprawling campus built from pale purple bricks and nearly black accents.

A massive mural adorns the Academyâ€™s outer walls, depicting a celestial event â€” a lunar eclipse and comet crossing above a mystical portal, which a lone figure is shown sealing.

Founded over a century ago, the Academy is currently run by Headmaster Azareth "Ozzie" Pervell, who has held the position (and his Chronurgy Wizard program chair) for 75 years.

### Structure:
- Students divided by program during first two years.
- Final Year: Randomly sorted into adventuring parties on Day 1 of Year 3.
- 9-month fieldwork assignments.
- Graduation: Summer Solstice during the Rose Festival.

### Notes:
- Enrollment is currently at a historic high due to the mysterious disappearances around Liligorn.

## General Description
A prestigious institution perched atop rolling green cliffs overlooking the sea. Its towers are topped with golden spires and ancient weathered statues of long-forgotten heroes. The Academy is both a school and a proving ground â€” a place where raw talent is honed, but survival is never guaranteed.

Students train not just in magic or swordplay, but in diplomacy, strategy, planar theory, and survival against cosmic odds.  
Whispers say the Academy is older than the kingdom itself.

## Notable Features
- **The Astrarium:**  
  A domed observatory for studying the movement of stars, planes, and omens. Heavily warded to prevent tampering.

- **The Duel Gardens:**  
  Enchanted fields where students practice combat under controlled magical conditions. Injuries are frequent; deaths, rare (but not unheard of).

- **The Gossamer Library:**  
  Home to ancient tomes on history, magic, and planar travel. Some books whisper back if read too long.

- **The Fountain of Twin Heroes:**  
  Site of Luella Candirâ€™s death and the party's first major confrontation with a greater threat.

- **The Pegasus Inn:**  
  Popular off-campus hangout for students and adventurers alike.

## Important Inhabitants
- **Headmaster Ozzie:**  
  Eccentric gnome wizard with a love for extremely tall hats and incomprehensible metaphors. Cares deeply for his students, even when hidden behind bizarre behavior.

- **Professor Montworthy:**  
  Tiefling Warlock instructor. Known for "recruiting" promising students into questionable pacts under the guise of "career counseling."

- **Professor Xun:**  
  Aberrant Mind Sorcerer and guardian of students like Emrys. Suspicious of the Academyâ€™s political entanglements.

- **Githilda Tearsbane:**  
  Time Cleric advisor, tied deeply to Charonâ€™s studies. Treats life like a clock whose gears are dangerously worn.

## Recent Events
- **The Wisp Attack:**  
  A sudden, unexplained soul-siphoning event resulting in Luella Candirâ€™s death.

- **Queenâ€™s Influence:**  
  Queen Alexandria has begun funding the Academy, shifting its leadership toward more nationalistic and expansionist ideals.

## Cultural Notes
- **House Rivalries:**  
  Students often split into unofficial "crews" based on disciplines like Arcanists, Blademasters, and Wilders.

- **Graduation Trials:**  
  Students must survive a real-world assignment known as the Field Trials â€” and not all return.

- **Unofficial Traditions:**  
  - Students who survive an assassination attempt before finals are allowed to request an automatic passing grade (rare, but thereâ€™s precedent).  
  - Legends say dueling a professor and surviving earns a secret medalâ€¦ or eternal detention.

## Rumors and Secrets
