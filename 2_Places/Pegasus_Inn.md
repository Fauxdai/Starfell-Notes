# 🛏️ Pegasus Inn
[Home](/README.md)
---

## General Description
A well-loved inn sitting just outside the eastern walls of Breckindale Academy. Pegasus Inn is the unofficial hub for students, young adventurers, and mercenaries in training.  
It’s famous for its affordable rooms, cheap drinks, wildly inconsistent food, and near-constant bardic performances ranging from brilliant to "painfully experimental."

The Pegasus Inn's walls are layered with messages from decades of students: graffiti spells, secret dueling oaths, lost love poems, and rude sketches of professors.

## Notable Features
- **The Common Room:**  
  Always crowded, chaotic, and half-sung with drunken ballads or half-baked magical duels. Tables are covered with carvings, spilled ale, and scheming students.

- **The Skyloft:**  
  An attic converted into an exclusive dormitory for party members, sketchy professors, and certain "preferred" patrons. The view of Breckindale from here is breathtaking — if you can survive the climb.

- **The Pegasus Stables:**  
  Run-down but still functional. Also rumored to house a few "experimental" mounts, not all of them entirely terrestrial.

## Important Inhabitants
- **Mistress Harridan:**  
  A gruff halfling proprietress who runs the inn with an iron spoon and a faster tongue. Known for tolerating just about anything... unless you threaten her regulars.

- **Roach:**  
  The eternally drunk stableboy. No one knows if Roach has a real name. He can find you anything — for a price — but you might not like what you get.

- **"The Choir":**  
  A trio of bardic students who live permanently in the inn's basement and are banned from multiple taverns across the region.

## Recent Events
- **Blackboard Wars:**  
  Ongoing student prank war where spell-graffiti changes daily, and points are awarded for creativity, risk, and audience reaction.

- **The Great Cider Flood:**  
  Resulted from Emrys "accidentally" casting *Control Water* at a drink-off. Flooded the kitchens, and the cellar still smells like apples.

- **Night of the Six Summonings:**  
  A fateful evening when too many "Summon Familiar" spells collided in the bar, resulting in the brief, hilarious reign of a tiny demon lord named "Sir Piddlesnort."

## Cultural Notes
- **Unofficial Rules:**  
  - No duels before second breakfast.  
  - If you’re bleeding, sit at the left-side tables.  
  - No fireball spells inside the common room (three strikes policy).

- **Events:**  
  - "Tavern Tales Tuesday" — impromptu story competitions judged by bar patrons.  
  - "Mystery Brew Night" — discounted drinks of highly questionable origin.

- **Local Sayings:**  
  - "If you didn’t wake up on the roof, did you even stay at the Pegasus?"

## Rumors and Secrets
- Mistress Harridan allegedly keeps a stash of blackmail material on every Academy professor who’s ever stayed overnight.
- Some claim the Pegasus itself is a mildly sentient building — occasionally shifting doors and ceilings to play tricks on drunks.
